# Weather Application
This project introduces a comprehensive Weather Application aimed at equipping users with vital meteorological insights. Much like how a Kanban board visualizes tasks and progress, our application seeks to present weather data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner, enabling individuals to plan their activities with greater precision.

## Features
- Displays the current time.
- Provides the current temperature along with daily high and low temperatures.
- Indicates the probability of precipitation for the day.
- Offers a 7-day weather outlook, helping users plan for the week ahead.
- Lock down the movement of the application to prevent accidental movement

## Insights and Takeaways
During the development of this Weather Application, several insights and takeaways were gained that can be useful for future projects.
- 1 - Puppeteer: While developing my Weather App, I was met with rate limits on several weather APIsâ€”a frustrating barrier, especially when seeking the latest information. This challenge steered me towards web scraping as a potential solution. I settled on Puppeteer, not only for its ease of use but also its compatibility with my tech stack. Puppeteer proved to be a versatile tool, elevating my flexibility in data collection and underscoring the notion that multiple paths can lead to a solution.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building this Weather Application was a great learning experience that helped me develop my skills as a developer. Through the development process, I gained valuable insights and takeaways regarding web and desktop application development, such as the importance of using web scrapping in order to extract data.

Overall, I am proud of the strides I made with this Weather App, and I genuinely believe it can serve as a valuable resource for those seeking up-to-date weather insights. I hope this README file offers a clear and thorough overview of the app's features and functionalities. My aspiration is that it encourages others to embark on their own journey, whether that's refining a weather application or delving into similar projects.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for taking the time to read this README file and for considering my Weather Application project!
